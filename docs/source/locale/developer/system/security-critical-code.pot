msgid "Below is a list of security-critical (i.e., trusted) code components in Qubes OS. A successful attack against any of these components could compromise the system's security. This code can be thought of as the Trusted Computing Base (TCB) of Qubes OS. One of the main goals of the project is to keep the TCB to an absolute minimum. The size of the current TCB is on the order order of hundreds of thousands of lines of C code, which is several orders of magnitude less than other OSes. (In Windows, Linux, and Mac OSes, the amount of trusted code is typically on the order of tens of *millions* of lines of C code.)"

However, Qubes allows for the existence of more than one NetVM, so the adversary would not be able to use `sys-net-1` in order to attack VMs connected to a *different* NetVM, `sys-net-2` without also compromising `sys-net-2`. In addition, the adversary would not be able to use `sys-net-1` (or, for that matter, `sys-net-2`) to attack VMs that have networking disabled (i.e., VMs that are not connected to any NetVM)."

We could have the most secure architecture and the most bulletproof TCB that perfectly isolates all domains from each other, but it would all be pretty useless if all the code we ran inside our domains (e.g. the code in our email clients, word processors, and web browsers) were backdoored. In that case, only network-isolated domains would be somewhat trustworthy."

In practice, we trust the software provided by the [Fedora Project](https://getfedora.org/). This software is signed by Fedora distribution keys, so it is also critical that the tools used in domains for software updates (`dnf` and `rpm`) are trustworthy."
