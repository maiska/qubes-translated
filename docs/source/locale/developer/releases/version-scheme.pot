msgid "We intend to make it easy to make a remix of Qubes, targeting another hypervisor or isolation provider. We may also create commercial products intended for specific circumstances. There is one distinguished distribution called **Qubes OS**. All source code for it is available for download under GPL license and is openly developed on the mailing lists. The rest of this document discusses Qubes OS. Another remix may have its own version series."

msgid "Qubes OS as a whole is released from time to time. Version scheme for all releases is modeled after Linux kernel version numbers. When announcing a new release, we decide on the major.minor version (like `3.0`) and release `3.0-rc1`. When we feel that enough progress has been made, we put `3.0-rc2` and so on. All these versions are considered unstable and not ready for production. You may ask for support on mailing lists (specifically **qubes-devel**), but it is not guaranteed (you may for example get answer “update to newer `-rc`”). Public ISO image may or may not be available."

Core components are branched at this moment and bugfixes are backported from master branch. Please see [Help, Support, Mailing Lists, and Forum](/support/) for places to ask questions about stable releases. No major features and interface incompatibilities are to be included in this release. We release bugfixes as `3.0.1`, `3.0.2` and so on, while new features come into the next release e.g. `3.1-rcX`."
