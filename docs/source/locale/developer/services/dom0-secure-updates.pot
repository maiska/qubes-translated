msgid "Normally there should be few reasons for updating software in Dom0. This is because there is no networking in Dom0, which means that even if some bugs will be discovered e.g. in the Dom0 Desktop Manager, this really is not a problem for Qubes, because all the third-party software running in Dom0 is not accessible from VMs or network in any way. Some exceptions to the above include: Qubes GUI daemon, Xen store daemon, and disk back-ends (we plan to move the disk backends to untrusted domain in Qubes 2.0). Of course we believe this software is reasonably secure and we hope it will not need patching."

msgid "Dom0 is the most trusted domain on Qubes OS, and for this reason we decided to design Qubes in such a way that Dom0 is not connected to any network. In fact only certain domains can be connected to a network via so-called network domains. There can also be more than one network domain, e.g. in case the user is connected to more than one physically or logically separated networks."

msgid "Updates (\\*.rpm files) are checked and downloaded by UpdateVM, which by default is the same as the firewall VM, but can be configured to be any other, network-connected VM. This is done by [qubes-download-dom0-updates.sh script](https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-core-agent-linux/blob/release2/misc/qubes-download-dom0-updates.sh) (this script is executed using qrexec by the previously mentioned qubes-dom0-update). Note that we assume that this script might get compromised and fetch maliciously compromised downloads -- this is not a problem as Dom0 verifies digital signatures on updates later. The downloaded rpm files are placed in a ~~~/var/lib/qubes/dom0-updates~~~ directory on UpdateVM filesystem (again, they might get compromised while being kept there, still this isn't a problem). This directory is passed to yum using the ~~~--installroot=~~~ option."

This service is implemented by [qubes-receive-updates script](https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-core-admin-linux/blob/release2/dom0-updates/qubes-receive-updates) running in Dom0. The Dom0's qubes-dom0-update script (which originally initiated the whole update process) waits until qubes-receive-updates finished."
