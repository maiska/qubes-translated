This process is designed to ensure that contributed text is accurate and non-malicious. This process is a best effort that should provide a reasonable degree of assurance, but it is not foolproof. For example, all text characters are checked for ANSI escape sequences. However, binaries, such as images, are simply checked to ensure they appear or function the way they should when the website is rendered. They are not further analyzed in an attempt to determine whether they are malicious."

In cases in which another reviewer is not required, the documentation maintainer may review the pull request (in which case no signed comment is necessary, since it would be redundant with the signed tag)."

msgid "Duplicating documentation is almost always a bad idea. There are many reasons for this. The main one is that almost all documentation has to be updated as some point. When similar documentation appears in more than one place, it is very easy for it to get updated in one place but not the others (perhaps because the person updating it doesn't realize it's in more than once place). When this happens, the documentation as a whole is now inconsistent, and the outdated documentation becomes a trap, especially for novice users. Such traps are often more harmful than if the documentation never existed in the first place. The solution is to **link** to existing documentation rather than duplicating it. There are some exceptions to this policy (e.g., information that is certain not to change for a very long time), but they are rare."

External documentation should not be submitted to [qubes-doc](https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-doc). If you've written a piece of documentation that is not appropriate for [qubes-doc](https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-doc), we encourage you to submit it to the [Qubes Community](https://github.com/Qubes-Community) project instead. However, *linking* to external documentation from [qubes-doc](https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-doc) is perfectly fine. Indeed, the maintainers of the [Qubes Community](https://github.com/Qubes-Community) project should regularly submit PRs against the documentation index (see [How to edit the documentation index](#how-to-edit-the-documentation-index)) to add and update Qubes Community links in the \"External Documentation\" section of the documentation table of contents."

msgid "The main difference between **core** (or **official**) and **external** (or **community** or **unofficial**) documentation is whether it documents software that is officially written and maintained by the Qubes OS Project. The purpose of this distinction is to keep the core docs maintainable and high-quality by limiting them to the software output by the Qubes OS Project. In other words, we take responsibility for documenting all of the software we put out into the world, but it doesn't make sense for us to take on the responsibility of documenting or maintaining documentation for anything else. For example, Qubes OS may use a popular Linux distribution for an official [TemplateVM](/doc/templates/). However, it would not make sense for a comparatively small project like ours, with modest funding and a lean workforce, to attempt to document software belonging to a large, richly-funded project with an army of paid and volunteer contributors, especially when they probably already have documentation of their own. This is particularly true when it comes to Linux in general. Although many users who are new to Qubes are also new to Linux, it makes absolutely no sense for our comparatively tiny project to try to document Linux in general when there is already a plethora of documentation out there."

They may wish to write documentation and submit it to the core docs, but they see only their own writing process and fail to consider that it will have to be kept up-to-date and consistent with the rest of the docs for years afterward. Submissions to the core docs also have to go through a review process to ensure accuracy before being merged (see [security](#security)), which takes up valuable time from the team. We aim to maintain high quality standards for the core docs (style and mechanics, formatting), which also takes up a lot of time. If the documentation involves anything external to the Qubes OS Project (such as a website, platform, program, protocol, framework, practice, or even a reference to a version number), the documentation is likely to become outdated when that external thing changes. It's also important to periodically review and update this documentation, especially when a new Qubes release comes out. Periodically, there may be technical or policy changes that affect all the core documentation. The more documentation there is relative to maintainers, the harder all of this will be. Since there are many more people who are willing to write documentation than to maintain it, these individually small incremental additions amount to a significant maintenance burden for the project."

The community is better positioned to write and maintain documentation that applies, combines, and simplifies the official documentation, e.g., tutorials that explain how to install and use various programs in Qubes, how to create custom VM setups, and introductory tutorials that teach basic Linux concepts and commands in the context of Qubes. In addition, just because the Qubes OS Project has officially written and maintains some flexible framework, such as `qrexec`, it does not make sense to include every tutorial that says \"here's how to do something cool with `qrexec`\" in the core docs. Such tutorials generally also belong in the community documentation."

Many of them are tempted to *replace* existing content that applies to an older, supported version with content that applies only to the latest version. This is somewhat understandable. Since they only use the latest version, they may be focused on their own experience, and they may even regard the older version as deprecated, even when it's actually still supported. However, allowing this replacement of content would do a great disservice to those who still rely on the older, supported version. In many cases, these users value the stability and reliability of the older, supported version. With the older, supported version, there has been more time to fix bugs and make improvements in both the software and the documentation. Consequently, much of the documentation content for this version may have gone through several rounds of editing, review, and revision. It would be a tragedy for this content to vanish while the very set of users who most prize stability and reliability are depending on it."

In the correct example, the reader can simply skim the headings in order to know which parts of the page need to be read and which can be safely ignored. The fact that some content is repeated in the two version-specific sections is not a problem, since no reader has to read the same thing twice. Moreover, as one version gets updated, it's likely that the documentation for that version will also be updated. Therefore, content that is initially duplicated between version-specific sections will not necessarily stay that way, and this is a good thing: We want the documentation for a version that *doesn't* change to stay the same, and we want the documentation for a version that *does* change to change along with the software."

Over time, the different branches would diverge in non-version-specific content. Good general content that was submitted only to one branch would effectively disappear once that version was deprecated. (Even if it were still on the website, no one would look at it, since it would explicitly be in the subdirectory of a  deprecated version, and there would be a motivation to remove it from the website so that search results wouldn't be populated with out-of-date information.)"
