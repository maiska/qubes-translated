On the contrary, we are fortunate to have such a helpful and understanding community that many of them spend hours of their personal time helping complete strangers, including many who post anonymously.

We've heard from some users who find the mailing lists to be a bit intimidating or who may feel that their message isn't important enough to merit creating a new email that lands in thousands of inboxes. Others want more selective control over topic notifications. Some users simply appreciate the ability to add a \"reaction\" to a message instead of having to add an entirely new reply. Whatever your reasons, it's up to you to decide where and how you want to join the conversation."

We believe that this additional venue fosters the continued growth of community participation and improves everyone's experience. In addition, we fully expect that many community members -- especially the most active ones -- will choose to participate in both venues.
