msgid "The short version is that we try to respect your privacy as much as possible. We absolutely do not sell any user data. In fact, we go out of our way to help you keep your data private from everyone, including us. For example, from the moment you [install Qubes OS](/doc/installation-guide/), we offer to set up [Whonix](https://www.whonix.org/) so that all of your updates are routed through [Tor](https://www.torproject.org/)."

msgid "This is just a static website generated with Jekyll and hosted from GitHub Pages. We try to use as little JavaScript as possible. We host all resources locally (no third-party CDNs) so that you only have to connect to one domain. This site should be easy to browse using Tor Browser and with scripts blocked. We also have an [onion service](http://qubesosfasa4zl44o4tws22di6kepyzfeqv3tg4e3ztknltfxqrymdad.onion/) (access is not logged). We even go out of our way to make it easy to download [this website's git repo](https://github.com/QubesOS/qubesos.github.io), including all the website source code, so that you can host this entire site from your own local machine offline. Better yet, we've specifically written all of the [documentation](/doc/) in Markdown so that the plain text can be enjoyed from the comfort of your terminal. Here's the [repo](https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-doc). (By the way, Git tags on our repos are PGP-signed so you can [verify](/doc/verifying-signatures) the authenticity of the content.) Obviously, we don't use any ads or trackers, but this is still a public website, so man-in-the-middle attacks and such are always a possibility. Please be careful. See [FAQ: Should I trust this website?](/faq/#should-i-trust-this-website)"

In other words, Qubes OS does not have the ability to \"phone home\" and is intentionally architected to forbid that from happening. This is mainly because we have ensured that dom0 has no network access."
