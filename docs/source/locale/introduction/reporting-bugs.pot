When developers come back to an issue to work on it, we do not want them to have to sift through a large number of unnecessary comments before they can get started. In many cases, an issue that gets \"too big\" essentially becomes more trouble than it's worth, and no developer will touch it (also see [every issue must be about a single, actionable thing](#every-issue-must-be-about-a-single-actionable-thing)). In these cases, we sometimes have to close the issue and open a new one. This is a waste of energy for everyone involved, so we ask that everyone help to avoid repeating this pattern."

If an issue affects more than one Qubes version, we usually keep only one issue for all versions. The Qubes team will see your comment and reopen the issue, if appropriate. For example, you can leave a comment with additional information to help the maintainer debug it. Adding a comment will subscribe you to email notifications, which can be helpful in getting important updates regarding the issue. If you don't have anything to add but still want to receive email updates, you can click the \"Subscribe\" button at the side or bottom of the comments."

A great way to do this is by [generating and submitting a Hardware Compatibility List (HCL) report](/doc/hcl/#generating-and-submitting-new-reports), then linking to it in your issue. You may also need to use command-line tools such as `lspci`. If you're reporting a bug in a package that is in a [testing](/doc/testing/) repository, please reference the appropriate issue in the [updates-status](https://github.com/QubesOS/updates-status/issues) repository. Project maintainers really appreciate thorough explanations. It usually helps them address the problem more quickly, so everyone wins!"
