msgid "This Code of Conduct is a collaborative, evolving document that attempts to transparently set out a public set of standards regarding appropriate conduct in the Qubes OS Project. It is *not* intended to be a statement or endorsement, whether implicit or explicit, of any particular political or philosophical attitude, belief, or way of living. Rather, it is an attempt to find a reasonable middle ground among the inevitable disagreements regarding free expression that arise in a large, diverse community of people from around the world. It is intended to be a practical means of serving the best interests of our users, contributors, and the project itself. We welcome you to view the [history of changes](https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-doc/commits/master/about/code-of-conduct.md) to this document and the [discussion](https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues/2163) leading to its creation."

Please try not to get offended if you perceive your contributions as being met with distrust -- we are most definitely thankful and appreciative of your efforts, but must also remain vigilant in order to ensure continued quality and safeguard against potential sabotage."
