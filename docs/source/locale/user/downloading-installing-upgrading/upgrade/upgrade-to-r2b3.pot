msgid "Current Qubes R2 Beta 2 (R2B2) systems can be upgraded in-place to the latest R2 Beta 3 (R2B3) release by following the procedure below. However, upgrading in-place is riskier than performing a clean installation, since there are more things which can go wrong. For this reason, **we strongly recommended that users perform a [clean installation](/doc/installation-guide/) of Qubes R2 Beta 3**."

If something does go wrong, then the user can simply perform a clean installation, and no significant loss will have occurred (as long as the user [backed up](/doc/backup-restore/) correctly!)."
