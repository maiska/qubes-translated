msgid "In [How to Get Started](/doc/how-to-get-started/), we covered the distinction in Qubes OS between where you *install* your software and where you *run* your software. Your software is installed in [templates](/doc/glossary/#template). Each template shares its root filesystem (i.e., all of its programs and system files) with all the qubes based on it. [App qubes](/doc/glossary/#app-qube) are where you run your software and store your data."

A template should be used only for installation of packages, and nothing more, so it should never get a chance to actually run `/usr/bin/firefox` and get infected from it, in case it was compromised.

msgid "Not quite. Dom0 compromise is absolutely fatal, and it leads to Game Over<sup>TM</sup>. However, a compromise of a template affects only a subset of all your app qubes (in case you use more than one template, or also some standalones). Also, if your app qubes are network disconnected, even though their filesystems might get compromised due to the corresponding template compromise, it still would be difficult for the attacker to actually leak out the data stolen in an app qube. Not impossible (due to existence of covert channels between VMs on x86 architecture), but difficult and slow."

msgid "This might seem like an excellent anti-malware mechanism to be used inside the qube. However, one should be careful with treating this property as a reliable way to keep the qube malware-free. This is because the non-persistence, in the case of normal qubes, applies only to the root filesystem and not to the user filesystem (on which the `/home`, `/rw`, and `/usr/local` are stored) for obvious reasons. It is possible that malware, especially malware that could be specifically written to target Qubes, could install its hooks inside the user home directory files only. Examples of obvious places for such hooks could be: `.bashrc`, the Firefox profile directory which contains the extensions, or some PDF or DOC documents that are expected to be opened by the user frequently (assuming the malware found an exploitable bug in the PDF or DOC reader), and surely many others places, all in the user's home directory."

msgid "One advantage of the non-persistent rootfs though, is that the malware is still inactive before the user's filesystem gets mounted and \"processed\" by system/applications, which might theoretically allow for some scanning programs (or a skilled user) to reliably scan for signs of infections of the app qube. But, of course, the problem of finding malware hooks in general is hard, so this would work likely only for some special cases (e.g. an app qube which doesn't use Firefox, as otherwise it would be hard to scan the Firefox profile directory reliably to find malware hooks there). Also note that the user filesystem's metadata might got maliciously modified by malware in order to exploit a hypothetical bug in the app qube kernel whenever it mounts the malformed filesystem. However, these exploits will automatically stop working (and so the infection might be cleared automatically) after the hypothetical bug got patched and the update applied (via template update), which is an exceptional feature of Qubes OS."
