msgid "One of the most important security improvements introduced with the release of Qubes 4.0 was to replace paravirtualization (PV) technology with **hardware-enforced memory virtualization**, which recent processors have made possible thanks to so-called Second Level Address Translation ([SLAT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Level_Address_Translation)), also known as [EPT](https://ark.intel.com/Search/FeatureFilter?productType=processors&ExtendedPageTables=true&MarketSegment=Mobile) in Intel parlance. SLAT (EPT) is an extension to Intel VT-x virtualization, which originally was capable of only CPU virtualization but not memory virtualization and hence required a complex Shadow Page Tables approach. We hope that embracing SLAT-based memory virtualization will allow us to prevent disastrous security bugs, such as the infamous [XSA-148](https://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-148.html), which --- unlike many other major Xen bugs --- regrettably did [affect](https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-secpack/blob/master/QSBs/qsb-022-2015.txt) Qubes OS. Consequently, we require SLAT support of all certified hardware beginning with Qubes OS 4.0."

msgid "Another important requirement is that Qubes-certified hardware should run only **open-source boot firmware** (aka \"the BIOS\"), such as [coreboot](https://www.coreboot.org/). The only exception is the use of (properly authenticated) CPU-vendor-provided blobs for silicon and memory initialization (see [Intel FSP](https://firmware.intel.com/learn/fsp/about-intel-fsp)) as well as other internal operations (see [Intel ME](https://www.apress.com/9781430265719)). However, we specifically require all code used for and dealing with the System Management Mode (SMM) to be open-source."

msgid "While we [recognize](https://blog.invisiblethings.org/papers/2015/x86_harmful.pdf) the potential problems that proprietary CPU-vendor code can cause, we are also pragmatic enough to realize that we need to take smaller steps first, before we can implement even stronger countermeasures such as a [stateless laptop](https://blog.invisiblethings.org/papers/2015/state_harmful.pdf). A switch to open source boot firmware is one such important step. To be compatible with Qubes OS, the BIOS must properly expose all the VT-x, VT-d, and SLAT functionality that the underlying hardware offers (and which we require). Among other things, this implies **proper DMAR ACPI table** construction."

msgid "Finally, we require that Qubes-certified hardware does not have any built-in _USB-connected_ microphones (e.g. as part of a USB-connected built-in camera) that cannot be easily physically disabled by the user, e.g. via a convenient mechanical switch. Thankfully, the majority of laptops on the market that we have seen already satisfy this condition out-of-the-box, because their built-in microphones are typically connected to the internal audio device, which itself is a type of PCIe device. This is important, because such PCIe audio devices are --- by default --- assigned to Qubes' (trusted) dom0 and exposed through our carefully designed protocol only to select app qubes when the user explicitly chooses to do so. The rest of the time, they should be outside the reach of malware."

msgid "While we also recommend a physical kill switch on the built-in camera (or, if possible, not to have a built-in camera), we also recognize this isn't a critical requirement, because users who are concerned about it can easily cover it a piece of tape (something that, regrettably, is far less effective on a microphone)."

msgid "Similarly, we don't consider physical kill switches on Wi-Fi and Bluetooth devices to be mandatory. Users who plan on using Qubes in an air-gap scenario would do best if they manually remove all such devices persistently (as well as the builtin [speakers](https://github.com/romanz/amodem/)!), rather than rely on easy-to-flip-by-mistake switches, while others should benefit from the Qubes default sandboxing of all networking devices in dedicated VMs."
