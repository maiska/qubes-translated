msgid "With Qubes, it is possible to revert one of a VM's storage volumes to a previous state using the automatic snapshot that is normally saved every time a VM is shutdown. (Note that this is a different, lower level activity than the [Backup, Restoration, and Migration](/doc/backup-restore/) process.)"

msgid "In Qubes, when you create a new VM, it's volumes are stored in one of the system's [Storage Pools](/doc/storage-pools/). On pool creation, a revisions_to_keep default value is set for the entire pool. (For a pool creation example, see [Storing app qubes on Secondary Drives](/doc/secondary-storage/).) Thereafter, each volume associated with a VM that is stored in this pool inherits the pool default revisions_to_keep."

msgid "The output of the above command will also display the \"Available revisions (for revert)\" at the bottom. For a very large volume in a small pool, revisions_to_keep should probably be set to the minimum value of 1 to minimize the possibility of the pool being accidentally filled up by snapshots. For a smaller volume for which you would like to have the future option of reverting, revisions_to_keep should probably be set to at least 2. To set revisions_to_keep for this same VM / volume example:"
