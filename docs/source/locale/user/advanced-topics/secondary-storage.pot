msgid "These steps assume you have already created a separate [volume group](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/6/html/logical_volume_manager_administration/vg_admin#VG_create) and [thin pool](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/6/html/logical_volume_manager_administration/thinly_provisioned_volume_creation) (not thin volume) for your HDD. See also [this example](https://www.linux.com/blog/how-full-encrypt-your-linux-system-lvm-luks) if you would like to create an encrypted LVM pool (but note you can use a single logical volume if preferred, and to use the `-T` option on `lvcreate` to specify it is thin). You can find the commands for this example applied to Qubes at the bottom of this R4.0 section."
