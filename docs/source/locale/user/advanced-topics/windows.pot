Alternatively, only Xen's PV drivers can be installed if integration with Qubes isn't required or if the tools aren't supported on a give version of Windows. In the latter case, one would have to [enable inter-VM networking](/doc/firewall/#enabling-networking-between-two-qubes) to be able to exchange files with HVMs."
