msgid "**Use a different USB drive:**  If possible, try several drives of different sizes and formats.  This determines whether the problem stems from the flash drive or Qubes installer. Some laptops cannot read from an external boot device larger than 8GB.  If you encounter a black screen when performing an installation from a USB stick, ensure you are using a USB drive less than 8GB, or a partition on that USB less than 8GB and of format FAT32. Note that the Qubes installation image is over 4GB, so it may not fit on a smaller USB.  If a machine can not boot from a bigger USB, it may be too old to run Qubes."

If installation fails after using one tool, try a different one.  For example, if you are facing trouble installing Qubes after writing the ISO using Rufus, then try using other tools like balenaEtcher or the ``dd`` command.  In case the boot partition is not set to \"active\" after copying the ISO, you can use some other tool like `gparted` on a Linux system to activate it."
