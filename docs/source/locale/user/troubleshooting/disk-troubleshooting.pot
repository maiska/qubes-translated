msgid "If the disk is completely full, you will get an `Out of disk space` error that may crash your system because Dom0 does not have enough disk space to work. So it's good practice to regularly check disk space usage. Running the `df -h` command in dom0 terminal will show some information, but not include all the relevant details. The Qubes user interface provides a disk space widget. If you are unable to access the interface, the command line version is running `sudo lvs | head` and looking at top entry for LVM pool. For example:"

As you can see, the `sudo lvs | head` command includes additional important columns `Data%` and `Meta%`, shown in the above example to have the values 89% and 69% respectively."

But sometimes, an attempt to resize will look like it worked, when it in fact fails silently. If you then try the same operation in the dom0 console using the `qvm-volume extend` command, it fails with the error message: `resize2fs: Permission denied to resize filesystem`. This error indicates that a `resize2fs` will not work, unless `fsck` is run first. Qubes OS utilities cannot yet handle this case."
