msgid "Security updates are an extremely important part of keeping your Qubes installation secure. When there is an important security issue, we will issue a [Qubes Security Bulletin (QSB)](/security/qsb/) via the [Qubes Security Pack (`qubes-secpack`)](/security/pack/). It is very important to read each new QSB and follow any user instructions it contains. Most of the time, simply [updating your system normally](#routine-updates) will be sufficient to obtain security updates. However, in some cases, special action may be required on your part, which will be explained in the QSB."
