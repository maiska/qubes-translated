msgid "In Qubes 4.X, backups are encrypted and integrity-protected with [scrypt](https://www.tarsnap.com/scrypt.html). You will need a copy of this utility in order to access your data.  Since `scrypt` is not pre-installed on every GNU/Linux system, it is strongly recommended that you store a copy of it with your backups. If your distribution has `scrypt` packaged (e.g., Debian), you can install the package in the standard way using your distribution's package manager. Otherwise, you'll need to obtain a compiled binary (instructions below) or compile the program from source yourself. (Don't forget to [verify signatures](/security/verifying-signatures) first!) Note that versions of `scrypt` up to 1.2.0 (inclusive) do not support the `-P` option for easier scripting, which means you'll need to enter the passphrase for each file separately, instead of using `echo ... | scrypt`."
