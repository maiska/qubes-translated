"No operating system, not even Qubes, can help you if you're installing it on"
" hardware that is already compromised. This includes CPUs, GPUs, SSDs, HDDs,"
" the motherboard, BIOS/EFI/UEFI, and all relevant firmware. Unfortunately, "
"in today's world of undetectable supply chain attacks, there are no easy "
"solutions. (Tools like [Anti Evil Maid (AEM)](/doc/anti-evil-maid/) can help"
" with *maintaining* the trustworthiness of your hardware, but not with "
"establishing it in the first place.) Some users have chosen to use tools "
"like [Coreboot](https://www.coreboot.org/), [Heads](http://osresearch.net/),"
" and [Skulls](https://github.com/merge/skulls)."

"You should [verify](/security/verifying-signatures/) the PGP signature on "
"your Qubes ISO before you install from it. However, if the machine on which "
"you attempt the verification process is already compromised, it could "
"falsely claim that a malicious ISO has a good signature. Therefore, in order"
" to be certain that your Qubes ISO is trustworthy, you require a trustworthy"
" machine. But how can you be certain *that* machine is trustworthy? Only by "
"using another trusted machine, and so forth. This is a [classic "
"problem](https://www.ece.cmu.edu/~ganger/712.fall02/papers/p761-thompson.pdf)."
" While various [solutions](https://www.dwheeler.com/trusting-trust/) have "
"been proposed, the point is that each user must ultimately make a choice "
"about whether to trust that a file is non-malicious."
