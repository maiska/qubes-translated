"Current Qubes R2 Beta 2 (R2B2) systems can be upgraded in-place to the "
"latest R2 Beta 3 (R2B3) release by following the procedure below. However, "
"upgrading in-place is riskier than performing a clean installation, since "
"there are more things which can go wrong. For this reason, **we strongly "
"recommended that users perform a [clean installation](/doc/installation-"
"guide/) of Qubes R2 Beta 3**."
