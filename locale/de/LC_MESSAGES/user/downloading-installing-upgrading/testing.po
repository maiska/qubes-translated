"Every new update is first uploaded to the `security-testing` repository if "

"\"Sufficient testing\" is, in practice, a fluid term that is up the "
"developers' judgment. In general, it means either that no negative feedback "

"package has been in `current-testing` for long enough, depending on the "
"component and the complexity of the changes."

"A limitation of the current testing setup is that it is only possible to "
"migrate the *most recent version* of a package from `current-testing` to "
"`current`. This means that, if a newer version of a package is uploaded to "
"`current-testing`, it will no longer be possible to migrate any older "
"versions of that same package from `current-testing` to `current`, even if "
"one of those older versions has been deemed stable enough. While this "
"limitation can be inconvenient, the benefits outweigh the costs, since it "
"greatly simplifies the testing and reporting process."

"We use an [automated build process](https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-"

"title=\"Thumbs Down\"></span> on the package's associated issue would help "
"us to decide whether the package is ready to be migrated to a stable "
