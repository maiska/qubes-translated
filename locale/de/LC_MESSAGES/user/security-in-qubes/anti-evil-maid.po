"[Qubes security guidelines](https://github.com/Qubes-"
"Community/Contents/blob/master/docs/security/security-guidelines.md) dictate"
" that USB devices should never be attached directly to dom0, since this can "
"result in the entire system being compromised. However, in its default "
"configuration, installing and using AEM requires attaching a USB drive "
"(i.e., [mass storage "
"device](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB_mass_storage_device_class)) "
"directly to dom0. (The other option is to install AEM to an internal disk. "
"However, this carries significant security implications, as explained "
"[here](https://blog.invisiblethings.org/2011/09/07/anti-evil-maid.html).) "
"This presents us with a classic security trade-off: each Qubes user must "
"make a choice between protecting dom0 from a potentially malicious USB "
"drive, on the one hand, and protecting the system from Evil Maid attacks, on"
" the other hand. Given the practical feasibility of attacks like "
"[BadUSB](https://srlabs.de/badusb/) and revelations regarding pervasive "
"government hardware backdoors, this is no longer a straightforward decision."
" New, factory-sealed USB drives cannot simply be assumed to be \"clean\" "
"(e.g., to have non-malicious microcontroller firmware). Therefore, it is up "
"to each individual Qubes user to evaluate the relative risk of each attack "
"vector against his or her security model."

"For example, a user who frequently travels with a Qubes laptop holding "
"sensitive data may be at a much higher risk of Evil Maid attacks than a home"
" user with a stationary Qubes desktop. If the frequent traveler judges her "
"risk of an Evil Maid attack to be higher than the risk of a malicious USB "
"device, she might reasonably opt to install and use AEM. On the other hand, "
"the home user might deem the probability of an Evil Maid attack occurring in"
" her own home to be so low that there is a higher probability that any USB "
"drive she purchases is already compromised, in which case she might "
"reasonably opt never to attach any USB devices directly to dom0. (In either "
"case, users can--and should--secure dom0 against further USB-related attacks"
" through the use of a [USB VM](https://github.com/Qubes-"
"Community/Contents/blob/master/docs/security/security-"
"guidelines.md#creating-and-using-a-usbvm).)"
