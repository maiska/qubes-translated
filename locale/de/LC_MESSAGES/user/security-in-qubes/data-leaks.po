"There are several reasons for this, which will be explained below. However, "
"the main reason is that Qubes cannot prevent an attacker who has compromised"
" one app qube with restrictive firewall rules from leaking data via "
"cooperative covert channels through another compromised app qube with "
"nonrestrictive firewall rules."

"For example, suppose you have an `email` app qube. You have set the firewall"
" rules for `email` such that it can communicate only with your email server."
" Now suppose that an attacker sends you a GPG-encrypted message which "
"exploits a hypothetical bug in the GnuPG process. There are now multiple "
"ways the attacker could proceed to leak data (such as confidential email "
"messages) from `email`. The most obvious way is by simply emailing the data "
"to himself. Another possibility is that the attacker has also compromised "
"another one of your app qubes, such as your `netvm`, which is normally "
"assumed to be untrusted and has unrestricted access to the network. In this "
"case, the attacker might move data from `email` to the `netvm` via a covert "
"channel, such as the CPU cache. Such covert channels have been described and"
" even implemented in some \"lab environments\" and might allow for "
"bandwidths of even a few tens of bits/sec. It is unclear whether such "
"channels could be implemented in a real world system, where multiple VMs are"
" running at the same time, each handling tens or hundreds of processes, all "
"using the same cache memory, but it is worth keeping in mind. Of course, "
"this would require special malware written specifically to attack Qubes OS, "
"and perhaps even a specific Qubes OS version and/or configuration. "
"Nevertheless, it might be possible."

"Note that physically air-gapped machines are not necessarily immune to this "

"**Intentional leaks.** Malicious software which actively tries to leak data "

"**Intentional sniffing.** Malicious software trying to use side channels to,"
" e.g., actively guess some key material used in another VM by some non-"
"malicious software there (e.g., non-leak-proof GPG accidentally leaking out "
"bits of the private key by generating some timing patterns when using this "
"key for some crypto operation). Such attacks have been described in the "
"academic literature, but it is doubtful that they would succeed in practice "
"in a moderately busy general purpose system like Qubes OS where the attacker"
" normally has no way to trigger the target crypto operation explicitly and "
"it is normally required that the attacker trigger many such operations."

"Both Qubes firewall and an empty NetVM (i.e., setting the NetVM of an app "
"qube to \"none\") can fully protect against leaks of type 3. However, "
"neither Qubes firewall nor an empty NetVM are guaranteed to protect against "
"leaks of types 1 and 2. There are few effective, practical policy measures "
"available to end-users today to stop the leaks of type 1. It is likely that "
"the only way to fully protect against leaks of type 2 is to either pause or "
"shut down all other VMs while performing sensitive operations in the target "
"VM(s) (such as key generation)."
