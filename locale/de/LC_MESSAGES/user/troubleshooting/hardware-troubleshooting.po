"By default, the kernel that is installed in dom0 comes from the `kernel` "
"package, which is an older Linux LTS kernel. For most cases this works fine "
"since the Linux kernel developers backport fixes to this kernel, but for "
"some newer hardware, you may run into issues. For example, the audio might "
"not work if the sound card is too new for the LTS kernel. To fix this, you "
"can try the `kernel-latest` package -- though be aware that it's less "
"tested! (See [here](/doc/how-to-install-software-in-dom0/#kernel-upgrade) "
"for more information about upgrading kernels in dom0). In dom0:"

"Reboot when it's done installing. You can double-check that the boot used "
"the newer kernel with `uname -r`, which prints the version of the currently-"
"running kernel. Compare this with the output of `rpm -q kernel`. If the "
"start of `uname -r` matches one of the versions printed by `rpm`, then "
"you're still using the Linux LTS kernel, and you'll probably need to "
"manually fix your boot settings. If `uname -r` reports a higher version "
"number, then you've successfully booted with the kernel shipped by `kernel-"
"latest`."
