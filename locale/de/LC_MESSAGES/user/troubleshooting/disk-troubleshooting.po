"If the disk is completely full, you will get an `Out of disk space` error "
"that may crash your system because Dom0 does not have enough disk space to "
"work. So it's good practice to regularly check disk space usage. Running the"
" `df -h` command in dom0 terminal will show some information, but not "
"include all the relevant details. The Qubes user interface provides a disk "
"space widget. If you are unable to access the interface, the command line "
"version is running `sudo lvs | head` and looking at top entry for LVM pool. "
