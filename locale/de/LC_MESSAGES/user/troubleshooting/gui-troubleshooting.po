"When a qube starts, a fixed amount of RAM is allocated to the graphics "
"buffer called video RAM. This buffer needs to be at least as big as the "
"whole desktop, accounting for all displays that are or will be connected to "
"the machine. By default, it is as much as needed for the current display and"
" an additional full HD (FHD) display (1920×1080 8 bit/channel RGBA). This "
"logic fails when the machine has primary display in FHD resolution and, "
"after starting some qubes, a 4K display is connected. If the buffer is too "
"small, and internal desktop resize fails."
