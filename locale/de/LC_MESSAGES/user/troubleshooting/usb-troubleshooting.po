"Currently (until issue [1082](https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-"
"issues/issues/1082) gets implemented), if you remove the device before "
"detaching it from the qube, Qubes OS (more precisely, `libvirtd`) will think"
" that the device is still attached to the qube and will not allow attaching "
"further devices under the same name. This may be characterized by VM manager"
" crashes and the error message: `Houston, we have a problem`. The easiest "
"way to recover from such a situation is to reboot the qube to which the "
"device was attached. If this isn't an option, you can manually recover from "
"the situation by following the instructions at the [Block Devices "
"documentation](/doc/how-to-use-block-storage-devices/#what-if-i-removed-the-"
