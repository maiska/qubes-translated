"In [How to Get Started](/doc/how-to-get-started/), we covered the "
"distinction in Qubes OS between where you *install* your software and where "
"you *run* your software. Your software is installed in "
"[templates](/doc/glossary/#template). Each template shares its root "
"filesystem (i.e., all of its programs and system files) with all the qubes "
"based on it. [App qubes](/doc/glossary/#app-qube) are where you run your "
"software and store your data."

"qube which doesn't use Firefox, as otherwise it would be hard to scan the "
"Firefox profile directory reliably to find malware hooks there). Also note "
"that the user filesystem's metadata might got maliciously modified by "
"malware in order to exploit a hypothetical bug in the app qube kernel "
"whenever it mounts the malformed filesystem. However, these exploits will "
