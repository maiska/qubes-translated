"The inter-qube clipboard system is secure because it doesn't allow any qube "
"other than your selected target to steal any contents from the inter-qube "
"clipboard. Without such a system in place, any password you were to copy "
"from the password manager in your vault qube to another qube, for example, "
"would immediately be leaked to every other running qube in the system, "
"including qubes that are untrusted by default, such as `sys-net`. By giving "
"you precise control over exactly which qube receives the inter-qube "
"clipboard content, then immediately wiping the inter-qube clipboard "
"afterward, Qubes OS protects the confidentiality of the text being copied."

"However, one should keep in mind that performing a copy and paste operation "
"from *less trusted* to *more trusted* qube is always potentially insecure, "
"since the data that we copy could exploit some hypothetical bug in the "
"target qube. For example, the seemingly-innocent link that we copy from an "
"untrusted qube could turn out to be a large buffer of junk that, when pasted"
" into the target qube's word processor, could exploit a hypothetical bug in "
"the undo buffer. This is a general problem and applies to any data transfer "
"from *less trusted* to *more trusted* qubes. It even applies to copying "
"files between physically separate (air-gapped) machines. Therefore, you "
"should always copy clipboard data only from *more trusted* to *less trusted*"
" qubes."

"The above discussion assumes that you control which window is focused in "
"dom0 at the time of the paste. However, if your dom0 window manager is "
"configured to give focus to newly created windows (which, as of Qubes 4.0, "
"is true in the default install with Xfce), then a malicious qube could "
"\"steal the focus\" by creating a window just before you press Ctrl+Shift+V,"
" and it would receive the data instead of your intended target. (Focus "
"stealing is a risk any time you are typing confidential data, but a Qubes "
"clipboard paste probably presents the greatest risk of leaking an entire "
"password before you have time to react.) You may be able to mitigate this "
"risk by changing the window manager configuration. For example, with Xfce, "
"you could run `xfwm4-settings` in dom0, go to the \"Focus\" tab, and un-"
"check \"Automatically give focus to newly created windows\". However, we "
"have not confirmed whether such settings are sufficient to prevent a "
"malicious qube from stealing the focus in all cases."
