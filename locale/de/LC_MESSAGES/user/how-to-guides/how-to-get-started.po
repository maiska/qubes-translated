"Qubes OS is an operating system built out of securely-isolated compartments "
"called [qubes](/doc/glossary/#qube). For example, you might have a work "
"qube, a personal qube, a banking qube, a web browsing qube, and so on. You "
"can have as many qubes as you want! Most of the time, you'll be using an "
"[app qube](/doc/glossary/#app-qube), which is a qube intended for running "
"software programs like web browsers, email clients, and word processors. "
"Each app qube is based on another type of qube called a "
"[template](/doc/glossary/#template). More than one qube can be based on the "
"same template. Importantly, a qube cannot modify its template in any way. "
"This means that, if a qube is ever compromised, its template and any other "
"qubes based on that template will remain safe. This is what makes Qubes OS "
"so secure. Even if an attack is successful, the damage is limited to a "
"single qube."

"Suppose you want to use your favorite web browser in several different "
"qubes. You'd install the web browser in a template, then every qube based on"
" that template would be able to run the web browser software (while still "
"being forbidden from modifying the template and any other qubes). This way, "
"you only have to install the web browser a single time, and updating the "
"template serves to update all the qubes based on it. This elegant design "
"saves time and space while enhancing security."

"There are also some \"helper\" qubes in your system. Each qube that connects"
" to the Internet does so through a network-providing [service "
"qube](/doc/glossary/#service-qube). If you need to access USB devices, "
"another service qube will do that. There's also a [management "
"qube](/doc/glossary/#management-qube) that automatically handles a lot of "
"background housekeeping. For the most part, you won't have to worry about "
"it, but it's nice to know that it's there. As with app qubes, service qubes "
"and management qubes are also based on templates. Templates are usually "
"named after their operating system (often a [Linux "
"distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_distribution)) and "
"corresponding version number. There are many ready-to-use "
"[templates](/doc/templates) to choose from, and you can download and have as"
" many as you like."

"Last but not least, there's a very special [admin "
"qube](/doc/glossary/#admin-qube) which, as the name suggests, is used to "
"administer your entire system. There's only one admin qube, and it's called "
"[dom0](/doc/glossary/#dom0). You can think of it as the master qube, holding"
" ultimate power over everything that happens in Qubes OS. Dom0 is more "
"trusted than any other qube. If dom0 were ever compromised, it would be "
"\"game over.\" The entire system would effectively be compromised. That's "
"why everything in Qubes OS is specifically designed to protect dom0 and "
"ensure that doesn't happen. Due to its overarching importance, dom0 has no "
"network connectivity and is used only for running the [desktop "
"environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_environment) and [window "
"manager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Window_manager). Dom0 should never be"
" used for anything else. In particular, you should never run user "
"applications in dom0. (That's what your app qubes are for!)"

"You'll choose a **color** for each of your qubes out of a predefined set of "
"colors. Each window on your desktop will have its frame colored according to"
" the color of that qube. These colored frames help you keep track of which "
"qube each window belongs to and how trustworthy it is. This is especially "
"helpful when you have the same app running in multiple qubes at the same "
"time. For example, if you're logged in to your bank account in one qube "
"while doing some random web surfing in a different qube, you wouldn't want "
"to accidentally enter your banking password in the latter! The colored "
"frames help to avoid such mistakes."

"Most Qubes users associate red with what's untrusted and dangerous (like a "
"red light: stop! danger!), green with what's safe and trusted, and yellow "
"and orange with things in the middle. This color scheme also extends to "
"include blue and black, which are usually interpreted as indicating "
"progressively more trusted domains than green, with black being ultimately "
"trusted. Color and associated meanings are ultimately up to you, however. "
"The system itself does not treat the colors differently. If you create two "
"identical qubes --- black and red, say --- they'll be the same until you "
"start using them differently. Feel free to use the colors in whatever way is"
" most useful to you. For example, you might decide to use three or four "
"qubes for work activities and give them all the same color --- or all "
"different colors. It's entirely up to you."
