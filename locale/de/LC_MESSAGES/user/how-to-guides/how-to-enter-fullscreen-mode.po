"Normally, the Qubes GUI virtualization daemon restricts the VM from "
"\"owning\" the full screen, ensuring that there are always clearly marked "
"decorations drawn by the trusted Window Manager around each of the VMs "
"window. This allows the user to easily realize to which domain a specific "
"window belongs. See the [screenshots](/doc/QubesScreenshots/) page for "
"examples."

"If one allowed one of the VMs to \"own\" the full screen, e.g. to show a "
"movie on a full screen, it might not be possible for the user to know if the"
" applications/VM really \"released\" the full screen, or if it has started "
"emulating the whole desktop and is pretending to be the trusted Window "
"Manager, drawing shapes on the screen that look e.g. like other windows, "
"belonging to other domains (e.g. to trick the user into entering a secret "
"passphrase into a window that looks like belonging to some trusted domain)."

"However, it is possible to deal with fullscreen mode in a secure way "
"assuming there are mechanisms that can be used at any time to switch between"
" windows or show the full desktop and that cannot be intercepted by the VM. "
"The simplest example is the use of Alt+Tab for switching between windows, "
"which is a shortcut handled by dom0."

"Other examples such mechanisms are the KDE \"Present Windows\" and \"Desktop"
" Grid\" effects, which are similar to Mac's \"Expose\" effect, and which can"
" be used to immediately detect potential \"GUI forgery\", as they cannot be "
"intercepted by any of the VM (as the GUID never passes down the key "
"combinations that got consumed by KDE Window Manager), and so the VM cannot "
"emulate those. Those effects are enabled by default in KDE once Compositing "
"gets enabled in KDE (System Settings -\\> Desktop -\\> Enable Desktop "
"Effects), which is recommended anyway. By default, they are triggered by "
"Ctrl-F8 and Ctrl-F9 key combinations, but can also be reassigned to other "
"shortcuts."

"You can always put a window into fullscreen mode in Xfce4 using the trusted "
"window manager by right-clicking on a window's title bar and selecting "
"\"Fullscreen\" or pressing `alt` + `f11`. This functionality should still be"
" considered safe, since a VM window still can't voluntarily enter fullscreen"
" mode. The user must select this option from the trusted window manager in "
"dom0. To exit fullscreen mode from here, press `alt` + `space` to bring up "
"the title bar menu again, then select \"Leave Fullscreen\" or simply press "
"`alt` + `f11`. For StandaloneHVMs, you should set the screen resolution in "
"the qube to that of the host, (or larger), *before* setting fullscreen mode "
"in Xfce4."
