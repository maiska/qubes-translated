"**Warning:** Only dom0 exposes PCI devices. Some of them are strictly "
"required in dom0 (e.g., the host bridge). You may end up with an unusable "
"system by attaching the wrong PCI device to a VM. PCI passthrough should be "
"safe by default, but non-default options may be required. Please make sure "
"you carefully read and understand the **[security "

" in that VM. This can be useful if, for example, you have only one USB "
