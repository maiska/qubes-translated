"A USB qube acts as a secure handler for potentially malicious USB devices, "
"preventing them from coming into contact with dom0 (which could otherwise be"
" fatal to the security of the whole system). It thereby mitigates some of "
"the [security implications](/doc/device-handling-security/#usb-security) of "
"using USB devices. With a USB qube, every time you connect an untrusted USB "
"drive to a USB port managed by that USB controller, you will have to attach "
"it to the qube in which you wish to use it (if different from the USB qube "
"itself), either by using Qubes VM Manager or the command line (see "
"instructions above). The USB controller may be assigned on the **Devices** "
"tab of a qube's settings page in Qubes VM Manager or by using the [qvm-"
"pci](/doc/how-to-use-pci-devices/) command. For guidance on finding the "
"correct USB controller, see the [according passage on PCI-devices](/doc/how-"
"to-use-usb-devices/#finding-the-right-usb-controller). You can create a USB "
"qube using the management stack by performing the following steps as root in"
" dom0:"
