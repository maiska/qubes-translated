"It has three columns (from left to right): source, destination, and "
"permission. Each row is a rule. For example, the second row says that we're "
"**allowed** (third column) to copy a file (since this is the policy file for"
" `qubes.FileCopy`) **from** (first column) any VM tagged with \"work\" "
"**to** (second column) any VM tagged with \"work\". In other words, all the "
"VMs tagged with \"work\" are allowed to copy files to each other without any"
" prompts. (If the third column were \"ask\" instead of \"allow\", there "
"would be prompts. I.e., we would be **asked** to approve the action, instead"
" of it always being **allowed**.)"

"Now, the whole policy file is parsed from top to bottom. As soon as a rule "
"is found that matches the action being evaluated, parsing stops. We can see "
"what this means by looking at the third row. It says that we're **denied** "
"from attempting to copy a file **from** any VM tagged with \"work\" **to** "
"any VM whatsoever. (That's what the `@anyvm` keyword means -- literally any "
"VM in the system, except for dom0). But, wait a minute, didn't we just say "
"(in the second row) that all the VMs tagged with work are **allowed** to "
"copy files to each other? That's exactly right. The second and third rows "
"contradict each other, but that's intentional. Since we know that parsing "
"goes from top to bottom (and stops at the first match), we intentionally put"
" the second row above the third row so that it would take precedence. This "
"is how we create a policy that says: \"VMs tagged with 'work' are allowed to"
" copy files to each other but not to any *other* VMs (i.e., not to VMs that "
"*aren't* tagged with 'work').\""

"When an operation is initiated with a specific target, e.g. `qvm-copy-to-vm "
"other_work_vm some_file` the policy mechanism looks for a row matching "
"`source_work_vm other_work_vm PERMISSION`. In this case, assuming both VMs "
"have the `work` tag, the second row would match, and the operation would be "
"`allow`ed without any prompts. When an operation is initiated without a "
"specific target, e.g. `qvm-copy some_file`, the policy mechanism looks for a"
" row matching `source_work_vm @default PERMISSION`. In this case, the first "
"row indicates that the user should be prompted for the destination. The list"
" of destination VMs in the prompt is filtered to only include VMs that are "
"valid as per the policy (so in this example, only other work VMs would be "
"listed). If the first row was commented out, the second row would not match "
"(the `@default` placeholder is not included in `@tag:work`) but the third "
"row would match (the `@default` placeholder is included in `@anyvm`). The "
"`qvm-copy` operation would therefore terminate immediately with the message "
"`Request refused`, without prompting the user with a list of valid "
"destination VMs, and only `qvm-copy-to-vm` operations with valid "
"destinations would be allowed."

"The fourth row says that we're **denied** from copying files **from** any VM"
" in the system **to** any VM tagged with \"work\". Again, since parsing goes"
" from top to bottom, this doesn't mean that no files can ever be copied from"
" *any* VM to a VM tagged with \"work\". Rather, it means that only VMs that "
"match an earlier rule can do so (in this case, only VMs tagged with "
"\"work\")."

"The fifth and final row says that we're **asked** (i.e., prompted) to copy "
"files **from** any VM in the system **to** any VM in the system. (This rule "
"was already in the policy file by default. We added the first four.) Note "
"that it wouldn't make sense to add any rules after this one, since every "
"possible pair of VMs will match the `@anyvm  @anyvm` pattern. Therefore, "
"parsing will always stop at this rule, and no rules below it will ever be "
"evaluated."

"copying files to other VMs (without the \"work\" tag), and other VMs "
"(without the \"work\" tag) are denied from copying files to them. The fifth "
"rule means that the user gets prompted for any situation not already "
