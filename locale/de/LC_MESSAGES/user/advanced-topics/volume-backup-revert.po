"With Qubes, it is possible to revert one of a VM's storage volumes to a "
"previous state using the automatic snapshot that is normally saved every "
"time a VM is shutdown. (Note that this is a different, lower level activity "
"than the [Backup, Restoration, and Migration](/doc/backup-restore/) "
"process.)"

"In Qubes, when you create a new VM, it's volumes are stored in one of the "
"system's [Storage Pools](/doc/storage-pools/). On pool creation, a "
"revisions_to_keep default value is set for the entire pool. (For a pool "
"creation example, see [Storing app qubes on Secondary "
"Drives](/doc/secondary-storage/).) Thereafter, each volume associated with a"
" VM that is stored in this pool inherits the pool default revisions_to_keep."

"The output of the above command will also display the \"Available revisions "
"(for revert)\" at the bottom. For a very large volume in a small pool, "
"revisions_to_keep should probably be set to the minimum value of 1 to "
"minimize the possibility of the pool being accidentally filled up by "
"snapshots. For a smaller volume for which you would like to have the future "
"option of reverting, revisions_to_keep should probably be set to at least 2."
