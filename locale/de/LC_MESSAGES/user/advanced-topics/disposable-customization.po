"If a disposable template becomes compromised, then any disposable based on "

"make any risky customizations (e.g., installing untrusted browser plugins) "

"template is important because it is used by the \"Open in disposable\" "
"feature. This means that it will have access to everything that you open "
"with this feature. For this reason, it is strongly recommended that you base"
" the default disposable template on a trusted template and refrain from "
