"Since there is no networking in dom0, any bugs discovered in dom0 desktop "
"components (e.g., the window manager) are unlikely to pose a problem for "
"Qubes, since none of the third-party software running in dom0 is accessible "
"from VMs or the network in any way. Nonetheless, since software running in "
"dom0 can potentially exercise full control over the system, it is important "
"to install only trusted software in dom0."

"The install/update process is split into two phases: *resolve and download* "
"and *verify and install*. The *resolve and download* phase is handled by the"
" UpdateVM. (The role of UpdateVM can be assigned to any VM in the Qube "
"Manager, and there are no significant security implications in this choice. "
"By default, this role is assigned to the FirewallVM.) After the UpdateVM has"
" successfully downloaded new packages, they are sent to dom0, where they are"
" verified and installed. This separation of duties significantly reduces the"
" attack surface, since all of the network and metadata processing code is "
"removed from the TCB."

"Although this update scheme is far more secure than directly downloading "
"updates in dom0, it is not invulnerable. For example, there is nothing that "
"the Qubes OS Project can feasibly do to prevent a malicious RPM from "
"exploiting a hypothetical bug in the cryptographic signature verification "
"operation. At best, we could switch to a different distro or package "
"manager, but any of them could be vulnerable to the same (or a similar) "
"attack. While we could, in theory, write a custom solution, it would only be"
" effective if Qubes repos included all of the regular template distro's "
"updates, and this would be far too costly for us to maintain."
