"By default Qubes uses thin volumes for the disk images. This means that "
"space is not actually allocated for the volume until it is used. So a 2GB "
"private volume with 100M of files will only use 100M. This explains how you "
"can have *many* qubes with large private volumes on quite a small disk. This"
" is called over provisioning. You should keep an eye on the disk-space "
"widget to see how much free space you actually have."

"In case of standalone qubes and templates, just change the Disk Storage "
"settings above. In case of template-based qubes, the private storage (the "
"/home directory and user files) can be changed in the qube's own settings, "
"but the system root image is [inherited from the template](/doc/how-to-get-"
"started/), and so it must be changed in the template settings. If you are "
"increasing the disk image size for Linux-based qubes installed from Qubes OS"
" repositories in Qubes 4.0 or later, changing the settings above is all you "
"need to do - in other cases, you may need to do more, according to "
"instructions below. See also the OS-specific follow-up instructions below."
