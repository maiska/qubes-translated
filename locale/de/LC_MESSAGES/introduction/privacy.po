"The short version is that we try to respect your privacy as much as "
"possible. We absolutely do not sell any user data. In fact, we go out of our"
" way to help you keep your data private from everyone, including us. For "
"example, from the moment you [install Qubes OS](/doc/installation-guide/), "
"we offer to set up [Whonix](https://www.whonix.org/) so that all of your "
"updates are routed through [Tor](https://www.torproject.org/)."

"This is just a static website generated with Jekyll and hosted from GitHub "
"Pages. We try to use as little JavaScript as possible. We host all resources"
" locally (no third-party CDNs) so that you only have to connect to one "
"domain. This site should be easy to browse using Tor Browser and with "
"scripts blocked. We also have an [onion "
"service](http://qubesosfasa4zl44o4tws22di6kepyzfeqv3tg4e3ztknltfxqrymdad.onion/)"
" (access is not logged). We even go out of our way to make it easy to "
"download [this website's git "
"repo](https://github.com/QubesOS/qubesos.github.io), including all the "
"website source code, so that you can host this entire site from your own "
"local machine offline. Better yet, we've specifically written all of the "
"[documentation](/doc/) in Markdown so that the plain text can be enjoyed "
"from the comfort of your terminal. Here's the "
"[repo](https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-doc). (By the way, Git tags on our "
"repos are PGP-signed so you can [verify](/doc/verifying-signatures) the "
"authenticity of the content.) Obviously, we don't use any ads or trackers, "
"but this is still a public website, so man-in-the-middle attacks and such "
"are always a possibility. Please be careful. See [FAQ: Should I trust this "
"website?](/faq/#should-i-trust-this-website)"
