"It is always clearly visible to which domain a given window belongs. Here "
"it’s immediately clear that the passphrase-prompting window belongs to some "
"domain with the “blue” label. When we look at the titlebar, we see "
"“[qubes]”, which is the name of the actual domain. Theoretically, the "
"untrusted application (here, the red Tor Browser running in a DisposableVM) "
"beneath the prompt window could draw a similar looking window within its "
"contents. In practice, this would be very hard, because it doesn’t know, "
"e.g., the exact decoration style that is in use. However, if this is a "
"concern, the user can simply try to move the more trusted window onto some "
"empty space on the desktop such that no other window is present beneath it. "
"Or, better yet, use the Expose-like effect (available via a hot-key). A "
"malicious application from an untrusted domain cannot spoof the whole "
"desktop because the trusted Window Manager will never let any domain “own” "
"the whole screen. Its titlebar will always be visible."
