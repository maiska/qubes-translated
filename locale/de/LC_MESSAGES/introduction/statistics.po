"Before, we simply counted the number of unique Tor exit node IPv4 addresses "
"that connected to the Qubes update servers each month. However, this "
"underestimated the actual number of Tor users, since many Tor users can use "
"the same exit node. The new methodology is to estimate the number of Tor "
"users as a proportion of the total number of *requests* from Tor exit nodes "
"on the assumption that the proportion of users to requests is roughly the "
"same for both clearnet and Tor users. To be precise, the formula is:"
