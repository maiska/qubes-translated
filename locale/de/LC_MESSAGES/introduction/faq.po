"Qubes OS is a security-oriented operating system (OS). The OS is the "
"software that runs all the other programs on a computer. Some examples of "
"popular OSes are Windows, macOS, Android, and iOS. Qubes is free and open-"
"source software (FOSS). This means that everyone is free to use, copy, and "
"change the software in any way. It also means that the source code is openly"
" available so others can contribute to and audit it."

msgid ""
"Most people use an operating system like Windows or macOS on their desktop "
"and laptop computers. These OSes are popular because they tend to be easy to"
" use and usually come pre-installed on the computers people buy. However, "
"they present problems when it comes to security. For example, you might open"
" an innocent-looking email attachment or website, not realizing that you're "
"actually allowing malware (malicious software) to run on your computer. "
"Depending on what kind of malware it is, it might do anything from showing "
"you unwanted advertisements to logging your keystrokes to taking over your "
"entire computer. This could jeopardize all the information stored on or "
"accessed by this computer, such as health records, confidential "
"communications, or thoughts written in a private journal. Malware can also "
"interfere with the activities you perform with your computer. For example, "
"if you use your computer to conduct financial transactions, the malware "
"might allow its creator to make fraudulent transactions in your name."

msgid ""
"Unfortunately, conventional security approaches like antivirus programs and "
"(software and/or hardware) firewalls are no longer enough to keep out "
"sophisticated attackers. For example, nowadays it's common for malware "
"creators to check to see if their malware is recognized by any signature-"
"based antivirus programs. If it's recognized, they scramble their code until"
" it's no longer recognizable by the antivirus programs, then send it out. "
"The best of these programs will subsequently get updated once the antivirus "
"programmers discover the new threat, but this usually occurs at least a few "
"days after the new attacks start to appear in the wild. By then, it's too "
"late for those who have already been compromised. More advanced antivirus "
"software may perform better in this regard, but it's still limited to a "
"detection-based approach. New zero-day vulnerabilities are constantly being "
"discovered in the common software we all use, such as our web browsers, and "
"no antivirus program or firewall can prevent all of these vulnerabilities "
"from being exploited."

"This approach allows you to keep the different things you do on your "
"computer securely separated from each other in isolated qubes so that one "
"qube getting compromised won't affect the others. For example, you might "
"have one qube for visiting untrusted websites and a different qube for doing"
" online banking. This way, if your untrusted browsing qube gets compromised "
"by a malware-laden website, your online banking activities won't be at risk."
" Similarly, if you're concerned about malicious email attachments, Qubes can"
" make it so that every attachment gets opened in its own single-use "
"[disposable qube](/doc/dispvm/). In this way, Qubes allows you to do "

"Moreover, all of these isolated qubes are integrated into a single, usable "
"system. Programs are isolated in their own separate qubes, but all windows "
"are displayed in a single, unified desktop environment with unforgeable "
"colored window borders so that you can easily identify windows from "
"different security levels. Common attack vectors like network cards and USB "
"controllers are isolated in their own hardware qubes while their "
"functionality is preserved through secure [networking](/doc/networking/), "
"[firewalls](/doc/firewall), and [USB device management](/doc/usb-devices). "
"Integrated [file](/doc/copying-files) and [clipboard](/doc/copy-paste) copy "
"and paste operations make it easy to work across various qubes without "
"compromising security. The innovative [Template](/doc/template-"
"implementation) system separates software installation from software use, "
"allowing qubes to share a root filesystem without sacrificing security (and "
"saving disk space, to boot). Qubes even allows you to sanitize PDFs and "
"images in a few clicks. Those concerned about physical hardware attacks will"
" benefit from [Anti Evil Maid](/doc/anti-evil-maid/)."

"In addition, with features like improved ASLR, it is often more difficult to"
" exploit a bug on x64 Linux than x86 Linux. While we designed Qubes from the"
" beginning to limit potential attack vectors, we still realize that some of "
"the code running in Dom0, e.g. our GUI daemon or xen-store daemon, however "
"simple, might contain some bugs. Plus since we haven't implemented a "
"separate storage domain, the disk backends are in Dom0 and are \"reachable\""
" from the VMs, which adds up to the potential attack surface. So, having "
"faced a choice between 32-bit and 64-bit OS for Dom0, it was almost a no-"
"brainer. The 64-bit option provides some (little perhaps, but some) more "
"protection against some classes of attacks, and at the same time does not "

"And even though Qubes now \"needs\" a 64 bit processor, it didn't make sense"
" to run Qubes on a system without 3-4GB of memory, and those have 64-bit "
"CPUs anyway."
