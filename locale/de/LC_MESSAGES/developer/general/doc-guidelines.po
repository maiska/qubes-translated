"Duplicating documentation is almost always a bad idea. There are many "

" (perhaps because the person updating it doesn't realize it's in more than "

"It preserves good content for older (but still supported) versions. Many "
"documentation contributors are also people who prefer to use the latest "
"version. Many of them are tempted to *replace* existing content that applies"
" to an older, supported version with content that applies only to the latest"
" version. This is somewhat understandable. Since they only use the latest "
"version, they may be focused on their own experience, and they may even "
"regard the older version as deprecated, even when it's actually still "
"supported. However, allowing this replacement of content would do a great "
"disservice to those who still rely on the older, supported version. In many "
"cases, these users value the stability and reliability of the older, "
"supported version. With the older, supported version, there has been more "
"time to fix bugs and make improvements in both the software and the "
"documentation. Consequently, much of the documentation content for this "
"version may have gone through several rounds of editing, review, and "
"revision. It would be a tragedy for this content to vanish while the very "
"set of users who most prize stability and reliability are depending on it."

"It's hard for readers to miss information they need, since it's all in one "

"in any paragraph in the entire document, and there's no way to tell without "
"reading the entire page. In the correct example, the reader can simply skim "
"the headings in order to know which parts of the page need to be read and "
"which can be safely ignored. The fact that some content is repeated in the "
"two version-specific sections is not a problem, since no reader has to read "
"the same thing twice. Moreover, as one version gets updated, it's likely "
"that the documentation for that version will also be updated. Therefore, "
"content that is initially duplicated between version-specific sections will "
"not necessarily stay that way, and this is a good thing: We want the "
"documentation for a version that *doesn't* change to stay the same, and we "
"want the documentation for a version that *does* change to change along with"
" the software."
