"Below is a list of security-critical (i.e., trusted) code components in "
"Qubes OS. A successful attack against any of these components could "
"compromise the system's security. This code can be thought of as the Trusted"
" Computing Base (TCB) of Qubes OS. One of the main goals of the project is "
"to keep the TCB to an absolute minimum. The size of the current TCB is on "
"the order order of hundreds of thousands of lines of C code, which is "
"several orders of magnitude less than other OSes. (In Windows, Linux, and "
"Mac OSes, the amount of trusted code is typically on the order of tens of "
"*millions* of lines of C code.)"
