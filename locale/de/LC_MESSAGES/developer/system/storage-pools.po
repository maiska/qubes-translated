"Qubes OS R3.2 introduced the concept of storage drivers and pools.  This "
"feature was a first step towards a saner storage API, which is heavily "
"rewritten in R4. See [here](https://dev.qubes-os.org/projects/core-"
"admin/en/latest/qubes-storage.html) for documentation on storage pools in "
"R4."

"A storage driver provides a way to store VM images in a Qubes OS system. "
"Currently, the default driver is `xen` which is the default way of storing "
"volume images as files in a directory tree like `/var/lib/qubes/`."

"A storage pool driver can be identified either by the driver name with the "
"`driver` key or by the class name like this: "
"`class=qubes.storage.xen.XenStorage`. Because R3.2 doesn't use Python "
"`setup_hooks`, to actually use a short driver name for a custom storage "
"driver, you have to patch `qubes-core-admin`. You can use the `class` config"
" key instead, when your class is accessible by `import` in Python."

"A pool (in R3.2) is configuration information which can be referenced when "
"creating a new VM. Each pool is saved in `storage.conf`. It has a name, a "
"storage driver and some driver specific configuration attached."

"When installed, the system has, as you can see from the contents of "
"`/etc/qubes/storage.conf`, a pool named `default`. It uses the driver `xen`."
" The default pool is special in R3.2. It will add `dir_path=/var/lib/qubes` "
"configuration value from `defaults[pool_config]`, if not overwritten."

"Currently the only supported driver out of the box is `xen`. The benefit of "
"pools (besides that you can write your own storage driver e.g. for Btrfs) in"
" R3.2 is that you can store your domains in multiple places."
