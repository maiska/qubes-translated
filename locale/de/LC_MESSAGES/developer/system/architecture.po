"Qubes implements a security-by-compartmentalization approach. To do this, "
"Qubes utilizes virtualization technology in order to isolate various "
"programs from each other and even to sandbox many system-level components, "
"such as networking and storage subsystems, so that the compromise of any of "
"these programs or components does not affect the integrity of the rest of "
"the system."

"Qubes lets the user define many secure compartments known as "
"[qubes](/doc/glossary/#qube), which are implemented as lightweight [virtual "
"machines (VMs)](/doc/glossary/#vm). For example, the user can have "
"“personal,” “work,” “shopping,” “bank,” and “random” app qubes and can use "
"the applications within those qubes just as if they were executing on the "
"local machine. At the same time, however, these applications are well "
"isolated from each other. Qubes also supports secure copy-and-paste and file"
" sharing between qubes, of course."
