"We intend to make it easy to make a remix of Qubes, targeting another "

"document discusses Qubes OS. Another remix may have its own version series."

"Qubes OS as a whole is released from time to time. Version scheme for all "
"releases is modeled after Linux kernel version numbers. When announcing a "
"new release, we decide on the major.minor version (like `3.0`) and release "
"`3.0-rc1`. When we feel that enough progress has been made, we put `3.0-rc2`"
" and so on. All these versions are considered unstable and not ready for "
"production. You may ask for support on mailing lists (specifically **qubes-"
"devel**), but it is not guaranteed (you may for example get answer “update "
"to newer `-rc`”). Public ISO image may or may not be available."
