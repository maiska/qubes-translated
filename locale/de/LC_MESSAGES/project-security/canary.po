"A **Qubes Canary** is a security announcement periodically issued by the "
"[Qubes Security Team](/security/#qubes-security-team) through the [Qubes "
"Security Pack](/security/pack/) consisting of several statements to the "
"effect that the signers of the canary have not been compromised. The idea is"
" that, as long as signed canaries including such statements continue to be "
"published, all is well. However, if the canaries should suddenly cease, if "
"one or more signers begin declining to sign them, or if the included "
"statements change significantly without plausible explanation, then this may"
" indicate that something has gone wrong."

"The name originates from the practice in which miners would bring caged "
"canaries into coal mines. If the level of methane gas in the mine reached a "
"dangerous level, the canary would die, indicating to miners that they should"
" evacuate. See [Wikipedia: warrant "
"canary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warrant_canary) for more information, "
"but bear in mind that Qubes Canaries are not strictly limited to legal "
"warrants."
