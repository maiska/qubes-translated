"This tracker shows whether Qubes OS is affected by any given [Xen Security "
"Advisory (XSA)](https://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/). Shortly after a new XSA is "
"published, we will add a new row to this tracker. Whenever Qubes is "
"significantly affected by an XSA, a [Qubes Security Bulletin "
"(QSB)](/security/qsb/) is published, and a link to that QSB is added to the "
"row for the associated XSA."

" extremely unlikely that any up-to-date Qubes installations are vulnerable "

"concurrently with QSBs. Please read the QSB (if any) for each XSA for "
